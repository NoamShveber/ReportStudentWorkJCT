# Report Student Work JCT ![icon.png](icon.png)


This is a program with a simple UI to report hours in the JCT student work system. 

Instead of logging into the JCT VPN, then logging into the student work, then choose what day, then choose hours, etc.
everything is here, in a simple window, to insert easily and quickly.

just download and run main.py, install requirements if needed.
Enjoy!
